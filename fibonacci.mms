% Suppose you have a pair of rabbits. Rabbits reach maturity after one month and can produce a new pair of rabbits every month.
% That pair of rabbits also takes one month to mature, and once mature, they produce a new pair every month as well.
% The sequence of the number of rabbit pairs is generated by the Fibonacci sequence.
